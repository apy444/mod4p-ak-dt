# Logistic Regression with Lending Club data set

## Project Members:

**Data Scientists** - Andrea Koltai & Daniel Torres

**Flatiron School** - Data Science Fellowship Module 4 Project

## Project Goals:

The following project conducts an analysis on Lending Club dataset with scope on personal loans. Lending club data was colected from Kaggle's website. The scope of the project is to determine the probability of default from personal loans by applying a logistic regression. 
 

Research questions:
1) What is the probability of current loans to default?
2) Explore ways to increase our F1 score to have a less imbalance in the precision and recall in the confusion matrix.

Exploration:
1. Performed Logistic Regression with different strategies to handle imbalance dataset
